> _"Dulu, di sudut paling kelam desa terpencil di tanah Batak, seorang dukun serakah menantang batas alam. Ia menggelar ritual terlarang, menumpahkan darah manusia demi membuka gerbang dunia gaib. Namun yang datang bukan sekadar roh... tapi Begu Ganjang—makhluk tinggi tak wajar, matanya legam seperti lubang maut, haus jiwa dan dendam..."_
